# Multinational Retail Data Centralisation Project
### Notes

I started this project and wanted to do everything in Docker as I have used this tool a lot recently and use it instead of conda environments. I started by finding the images for postgres and pgadmin4 and seeing if I could indeed do it all with containers. I spent about 30 minutes working out why I couldn't access the pgadmin container via localhost:5000 or 5050 or any port I tried to set it to. In the end I managed to google enough things to get it to stick. I created a .env file for all the details. I believe it was adding PGADMIN_LISTEN_PORT=5050 and PGADMIN_LISTEN_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0 to the environment variables via the .env file that allowed me to change the access address from the default [::]:80 to 0.0.0.0:5050. Once I was connected I managed to connect to the postgres container by simply accessing the name of the container I had selected. Very nice.

I proceeded to set up the Docker Compose file and Dockerfile to boot the containers as I wanted with volumes for each. Next I added a third container for my python script, I will need to add more details to it as I work out which ports I will need to use.
